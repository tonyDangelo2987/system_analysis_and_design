# System Design and Analysis
This project is for a client named DriverPass. DriverPass is a driving education company. They wanted an online system for students and instructors where they could interact together. On the platform the system needed to allow the students to register for classes, take tests, and schedule on the road driving lessons. The system also needed to allow the instructors to grade student tests and schedule on the road driving lessons.

I constructed all of the system diagrams and models very well. I think I dropped the ball on the business design aspect that was part of the first project. I will focus more on that in the future.

To interpret the user's needs I read through the interview transcripts in detail. I also imagined myself as the multiple user roles. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it produces a quality product.

When approaching software design I usually focus on the user's needs first. I think about what the software/system needs to do and what the most efficient way to do that would be. In the future I can see myself using Class Diagrams and UML Diagrams to analyze and design a system. It makes the actual work much easier when you plan it out and visualize it this way.
